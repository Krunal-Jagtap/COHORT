/*
For security reasons, when a user logs out, their password should be removed from the user
object before storing it in logs or analytics.

Write a function that removes the password property from a user object and returns the
updated object.

Constraints
- user should be a valid object with at least a username and password.
- If password does not exist, return the object as it is.
