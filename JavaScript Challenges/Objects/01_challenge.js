/*
Imagine you are building an online school management system. Each student has a profile containing their name, age, and grade. You need to store this information in an object format so that it can be accessed easily when required.

Write a function that takes name, age, and grade as parameters and returns a student object containing these properties.

Constraints
- name should be a string.
- age should be a positive integer greater than 5.
- grade should be a string like "1 0th", "12th", etc.
- return "Invalid input" for wrong inputs.
*/

function createStudentProfile(name, age, grade) {
  // Return an object with name, age, and grade
  if (
    typeof name !== "string" ||
    typeof age !== "number" ||
    typeof grade !== "string" ||
    age <= 5 ||
    name === ""
  ) {
    return "Invalid input";
  } else {
    const student = {
      name: name,
      age: age,
      grade: grade,
    };

    return student;
  }
}
