/*
In many applications, data is stored in deeply nested objects. Accessing a property from a
deeply nested object requires multiple checks to avoid errors. Instead of manually checking
each level, we need a function that safely retrieves a value from a nested object using a dot-separated key path.

Write a function that takes a nested object and a key path string (e.g.,"user.address.city")
and returns the value. If any part of the path is missing, return "Key not found".

Constraints

- The input object should be valid.
- The key path should be a string with dot notation (.) separating keys.
- If a key is missing, return "Key not found".
- The function should handle deeply nested objects
*/

function getNestedValue(obj, keyPath) {
  // Return the value from the nested object based on keyPath

  let keys = keyPath.split(".");
  let current = obj;

  for (let key of keys) {
    if (current[key] === undefined) {
      return "Key not found";
    }
    current = current[key];
  }

  return current;
}
